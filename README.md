## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leksautomate/ChromaFFmpeg.git
cd ChromaFFmpeg
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
BASE_URL=http://your-vps-ip:9000
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
mkdir -p /data/outputs /data/folders
docker compose up --build -d
```

The API and UI are live at `http://your-vps-ip:9000`

---

## Updating the code on your VPS

SSH into your server. First find where the repo lives if you're unsure:

```bash
find / -name "docker-compose.yml" -not -path "*/proc/*" 2>/dev/null
```

Then `cd` into that directory and run:

```bash
# Pull latest
git pull origin master

# Remove old container and image
docker compose down
docker rmi chromaffmpeg-chromaffmpeg --force

# Rebuild and start fresh
docker compose up --build -d

# Watch logs
docker logs -f chromaffmpeg-chromaffmpeg-1
```

Your `.env` and `/data/` volumes are untouched — no files are lost.

---

## Web UI

Open `http://your-vps-ip:9000` in your browser. Enter your API key in the sidebar — it is saved to `localStorage`.

**Processing:**

- **Merge** — paste a video URL and audio URL, choose a length strategy, control volumes for both the added audio and the video's original audio
- **Animate** — apply Ken Burns zoom or pan animation to an image or video
- **Combine** — concatenate multiple files into one (optional re-encode for mixed codecs)
- **Image to Video** — convert a static image to MP4 with optional animation
- **Loop** — repeat a video clip N times
- **Transitions** — concatenate clips with animated xfade transitions
- **Metadata** — inspect any media URL

**Storage:**

- **Upload** — drag-and-drop or browse to upload any binary file; audio files go to the `audio` folder automatically, all others go to `upload`; optionally override with a custom folder name
- **Folders** — browse named folders (`upload`, `audio`, `main`, or custom), preview files inline, copy URLs, download, or delete
- **Storage** — browse all job output files, click any file to preview inline, copy URL, download, or purge

All result panels include an inline media preview, a copyable URL, and a download button. If an error occurs, a **▼ Show FFmpeg log** toggle reveals the raw FFmpeg stderr for diagnosis.

## Default Folders

Several endpoints automatically route output to named folders when no `folder` is specified:

| Endpoint | Default folder | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /upload` (audio file) | `audio` | `.mp3 .wav .m4a .ogg .aac .flac .opus .wma` |
| `POST /upload` (any other file) | `upload` | Video, image, or unknown type |
| `POST /combine` | `main` | Override with `"folder"` in the request body |
| `POST /merge` | *(no default — returns job URL)* | Set `"folder"` to save to a named folder |
| Other processing endpoints | *(no default — returns job URL)* | Set `"folder"` to save to a named folder |

All folders are **created automatically** if they don't exist. You never need to pre-create a folder before using it.

---

## API Reference

All endpoints require the header:

```
X-API-Key: your-secret-key
```

Interactive docs (Swagger UI): `http://your-vps-ip:9000/docs`

Processing endpoints return a `/store/` URL when a folder is used, or a `/files/` URL otherwise:

**With folder:**
```json
{
  "url": "http://your-vps-ip:9000/store/MyProject/a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "filename": "a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "folder": "MyProject"
}
```

**Without folder (job storage):**
```json
{
  "url": "http://your-vps-ip:9000/files/uuid/a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "filename": "a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "job_id": "uuid"
}
```

Output filenames are always **randomized** (8-character hex token + extension) to avoid collisions.

Some endpoints include an optional `"warning"` field when a fallback was applied (see `/merge`).

---

### POST /merge

Merges a video and audio file. Controls length mismatch strategy and independent volume for each audio source.

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video_url` | string | required | URL of the video file |
| `audio_url` | string | required | URL of the audio file to add |
| `strategy` | string | `"speed_match"` | How to handle length mismatch (see table below) |
| `audio_volume` | float | `1.0` | Volume multiplier for the added audio (`0.5` = half, `2.0` = double, max `4.0`) |
| `video_audio_volume` | float | `0.0` | Volume of the video's original audio to mix in (`0.0` = ignore, `0.3` = 30%) |
| `folder` | string | none | Save output to this named folder (auto-created if missing) |

**`strategy` values:**

| Value | Video longer than audio | Audio longer than video |
|---|---|---|
| `trim_or_slow` *(default)* | Trim video to audio length — stream copy, fast | Slow video down to fill the audio duration |
| `speed_match` | Speed up video to match audio | Slow video down to match audio |
| `trim` | Cut at whichever stream ends first | Cut at whichever stream ends first |

**Volume behaviour:**
- `audio_volume=1.0, video_audio_volume=0.0` (defaults) — replaces video audio entirely with the added audio at original volume
- `audio_volume=1.5` — boosts the added audio by 50%
- `video_audio_volume=0.2` — keeps the video's original audio at 20% and mixes it with the added audio
- When any volume param is non-default, audio is re-encoded to AAC

**Duration detection fallback:** If duration cannot be determined for either file, `trim` (`-shortest`) is applied automatically and a `"warning"` field is added to the response.

**curl:**

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "video_url": "https://example.com/clip.mp4",
  "loop_count": 3,
  "folder": "MyProject"

### POST /concat-transitions

Concatenates video clips with smooth FFmpeg xfade transitions between them.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/clip1.mp4",
    "https://example.com/clip2.mp4",
    "https://example.com/clip3.mp4"
  ],
  "transition": "fade",
  "transition_duration": 1.0,
  "folder": "MyProject"
}
```

`folder` is optional — see [folder output](#folder-output) below.

**`transition` values:** `fade` · `fadeblack` · `fadewhite` · `dissolve` · `pixelize` · `wipeleft` · `wiperight` · `wipeup` · `wipedown` · `slideleft` · `slideright` · `smoothleft` · `smoothright` · `radial` · `circleopen` · `circleclose`

**Requirements:**
- All clips must share the same resolution and frame rate
- Duration must be detectable for all clips — required to calculate xfade offsets
- If all clips have audio, `acrossfade` transitions are applied to audio automatically; if any clip lacks audio the output is video-only

**curl:**

```bash
# Fade transition between three clips
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/concat-transitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{

      "https://example.com/clip3.mp4"
    ],
    "transition": "fade",
    "transition_duration": 1.0
  }'

# Wipe left with a shorter transition
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/concat-transitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{
    "urls": [

      "https://example.com/clip2.mp4"
    ],
    "transition": "wipeleft",
    "transition_duration": 0.5
  }'

# Save output to a named folder
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/concat-transitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{
    "urls": [
      "https://example.com/clip1.mp4",
      "https://example.com/clip2.mp4",
      "https://example.com/clip3.mp4"
    ],
    "transition": "fade",
    "transition_duration": 1.0,
    "folder": "MyProject"
  }'
```

---

### Folder output

All processing endpoints accept an optional `"folder"` field. `/combine` defaults to `"main"` when omitted; all others return a `/files/` job URL when no folder is specified.

When `folder` is set (or defaulted):
- The output is copied into `/data/folders/{folder}/` (served at `/store/{folder}/`)
- The response returns a `/store/` URL and a `"folder"` key
- The folder is **created automatically** if it does not exist
- Folder names are sanitized — only alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores (max 64 chars)
- Output filenames are **randomized** — collisions are impossible

**Response shape (with folder):**
```json
{
  "url": "http://your-vps-ip:9000/store/MyProject/a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "filename": "a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "folder": "MyProject"
}
```

**Response shape (without folder — job storage):**
```json
{
  "url": "http://your-vps-ip:9000/files/uuid/a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "filename": "a3f8b2c1.mp4",
  "job_id": "uuid"
}
```

---

### POST /metadata

Returns duration, format, resolution, fps, bitrate, and stream counts for any media URL.

**Request body:**

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4" }
```

**curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/metadata \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "duration_seconds": 47.32,
  "duration_formatted": "0:00:47",
  "format": "mov",
  "size_bytes": 4823042,
  "video_streams": 1,

  "fps": 25.0,
  "bitrate_kbps": 2048
}
```

---

### POST /metadata/upload

Upload a binary file directly and get its metadata — no need to host the file first. The file is deleted from the server immediately after probing.

**curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/metadata/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/video.mp4"
```

**Response:** same shape as `POST /metadata`.

---

### POST /upload

Converts any binary file (video, audio, image, or anything else) into a persistent URL. Accepts multipart form data.

Files are always stored in a named folder. The default folder is chosen automatically by file type:

| File type | Default folder |
|---|---|
| `.mp3 .wav .m4a .ogg .aac .flac .opus .wma` | `audio` |
| Everything else (video, image, etc.) | `upload` |

Pass `folder=name` to override the default. The folder is created automatically if it does not exist. Filenames are **randomized** (e.g. `a3f8b2c1.mp3`) — no collisions.

**curl:**

```bash
# Upload a video — goes to "upload" folder automatically
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/video.mp4"

# Upload an audio file — goes to "audio" folder automatically
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/track.mp3"

# Override folder explicitly
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/photo.jpg" \
  -F "folder=my-project"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "url": "http://your-vps-ip:9000/store/audio/a3f8b2c1.mp3",
  "filename": "a3f8b2c1.mp3",
  "folder": "audio",
  "size_bytes": 4823042
}
```

Maximum file size: **500 MB**.

```

**Response:**

```json

## Error Handling

All errors return a JSON body with a consistent shape:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "error": "FFmpeg processing failed",
    "detail": "...raw FFmpeg stderr output..."
  }
}
```

The web UI surfaces the `error` message directly. A **▼ Show FFmpeg log** toggle reveals the full stderr so you can diagnose the root cause without touching the server.

**Common FFmpeg errors and fixes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No such file or directory` | Input URL unreachable or wrong path | Verify the URL is publicly accessible |
| `Invalid data found when processing input` | Corrupted or unsupported container | Re-download or convert the source file |
| `height not divisible by 2` | Odd pixel dimensions | Add `-vf scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2` |
| `Encoder libx264 not found` | FFmpeg binary missing codec | Use the full FFmpeg Docker image |
| `Output file is empty` | Silent failure — usually a filter error | Expand the FFmpeg log in the UI |
| xfade `Could not determine duration` | Clip has no duration metadata | Pre-process with `/metadata` to verify, or re-encode the source |
| `HTTP 413` on `/upload` | File exceeds 500 MB limit | Compress or split the file first |
| `File not found on server` | `/store/` or `/files/` URL points to a deleted file | Re-upload the file and use the new URL |

All FFmpeg and ffprobe errors are logged server-side (Python `logging`) with the full command line and stderr tail for every failed job.

## Storage

There are two independent storage areas:

| Area | Path (container) | Served at | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job outputs | `/data/outputs/{uuid}/` | `/files/{uuid}/{filename}` | Results from processing endpoints (no folder set) |
| Named folders | `/data/folders/{name}/` | `/store/{name}/{filename}` | Uploads and processing outputs routed to a folder |

**Built-in named folders** (created automatically on first use):

| Folder | Used by |
|---|---|
| `audio` | Audio file uploads (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, etc.) |
| `upload` | Non-audio file uploads (video, image, etc.) |
| `main` | `/combine` output (default) |

Both storage areas are Docker volumes that persist across container restarts. Neither path requires authentication to read — the URL itself acts as the access token. Add a reverse proxy with authentication if you need access control.

When a processing endpoint uses a `/store/` URL as input (e.g. feeding a merge output back into another merge), the server reads the file directly from disk — no HTTP round-trip needed.

Create both directories on the host before starting:

```bash
mkdir -p /data/outputs /data/folders
```

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `API_KEY` | Required. Secret key sent in `X-API-Key` header | — |
| `BASE_URL` | Public base URL embedded in returned file URLs | `http://localhost:9000` |
| `OUTPUTS_DIR` | Directory for job output files inside the container | `/data/outputs` |
| `FOLDERS_DIR` | Directory for named folder files inside the container | `/data/folders` |

## Notes

- Output files and uploaded files are **never deleted automatically** — purge via the UI or the DELETE endpoints
- `/files/` and `/store/` routes are **unauthenticated** — the URL acts as the access token; add a reverse proxy with auth if needed
- All output filenames are **randomized** (8-character hex + extension) — collisions are impossible
- Folders are **created automatically** — you never need to pre-create a folder before using it
- When a processing endpoint downloads a `/store/` or `/files/` URL from this server, it reads the file directly from disk (no HTTP round-trip) — this avoids Docker networking issues and is faster
- `/merge` with `audio_volume` or `video_audio_volume` re-encodes audio to AAC; without volume params it stream-copies audio (faster, lossless)
- The `zoompan` filter (`/animate`, `/image-to-video`) is CPU-intensive — a 6 s 1080p animation can take 30–90 s depending on hardware
- `/combine` with `reencode: false` requires all inputs to share the same codec, resolution, and sample rate; use `reencode: true` for mixed sources
- `/concat-transitions` requires all clips to share the same resolution and fps — the xfade filter errors if dimensions differ
- `/loop` uses the concat demuxer with stream copy — output is generated near-instantly regardless of loop count
- `/merge` duration probing tries the container header first, then falls back to stream-level headers; if both fail the response includes a `"warning"` and uses `-shortest` as a safe fallback
- `/upload` chunks file reads at 1 MB and enforces a 500 MB hard limit
